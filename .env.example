### ev_charge_controller ESS options
# LOAD_RESERVATION defines the amount of solar energy produced in Watts that you want to reserve for charging your ESS
# and running house (and other) loads. When the MINIMUM_ESS_SOC percentage is reached, this amount will be reduced with
# a division of the LOAD_RESERVATION by the LOAD_REDUCTION_FACTOR to begin favoring the charge of your electric vehicle.

### ABB B2x  kWh Meter integration
# if you have integrated an ABB B23/B24 RS-485 meter into your venusOS system you can toggle this option on
# and configure the topic it will read/write to in conf.py.  This will allow for bypassing the load reservation
# functionality and result in more precise and accurate surplus power calculations
